# Hi there, I'm MD Safki ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software developer interested in **AI**, **API** and **bot development**, and **web development**. I have experience in both backend languages such as **Python**, **Bash**, **Ruby**, and frontend languages such as **JavaScript**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, and some esoteric languages such as **Brainfuck**.

## What I'm currently working on

I'm currently working on a **chatbot project** that utilizes AI and natural language processing to provide helpful information to users. I'm also working on a web application that uses APIs to gather data and present it in an easy-to-understand way.

## How to reach me

You can reach me on **Telegram** at **@MD_Safki**. I'm always open to discussing new projects and ideas, so feel free to reach out!

## Projects I'm proud of

- **Chatbot project**: This project utilizes AI and natural language processing to provide users with helpful information. It's been a challenging but rewarding project, and I'm proud of what I've accomplished so far.
- **API data gathering app**: This web application uses APIs to gather data and present it in a user-friendly way. It's been a great opportunity to work with APIs and learn more about how they can be utilized in real-world applications.
- **Python automation scripts**: I've developed several Python scripts for automating common tasks and streamlining workflows. These scripts have been a huge time-saver and have allowed me to focus on more important aspects of development. One of my favorite scripts automates the process of setting up a new development environment by installing all the necessary packages and tools with just a few commands.

Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile! I'm always open to new opportunities and collaborations, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in working together.
